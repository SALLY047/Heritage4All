  # Heritage4ALL
  ## ðŸŽ¯ Overview
  An inclusive GenAI platform that uses NFC technology to make Cantonese opera accessible to minorities and people with disabilities through personalized multi-language and multi-sensory experiences.

  ## Functions & Purpose ðŸ’«
  ### 1. Foster Inclusive Engagement using NFC
  We aim to create platforms like mobile apps or NFC-triggered workshops to make it more interactive and fun to learn about Cantonese culture. There is a NFC tag for each exhibit. The user can save the information of the exhibits they find interesting by tapping their phone on the NFC tag and save it on the app. Afterwards, they can click on what they have saved in more details and ask for further information about it. 
  ### 2. Allow diverse groups to learn about Cantonese opera 
Cantonese opera is deeply rooted in Cantonese language and culture, but its appreciation should not be limited to Cantonese speakers. A multilingual app ensures that people from different linguistic backgrounds can engage with the content.

Language selection will be available upon first launching the app, with an intuitive interface allowing users to switch languages at any time. Audio narration or text-to-speech functionality will also be provided in each supported language to cater to users who prefer listening over reading, enhancing accessibility for visually impaired users or those with literacy challenges. 

Users can share their favorite exhibits or learned facts on social media directly from the app, spreading awareness of Cantonese opera to broader, global audiences.
### 3. Make future improvements
The app will generate reports on which exhibits attract the most taps, indicating which aspects of Cantonese opera (e.g., costumes, music, or historical context) resonate most with visitors.

The app will track which exhibits are tapped most frequently, how long users spend viewing the associated content, and what features they engage in e.g., quizzes, videos, or AR experiences). It collects demographic data, such as age range, language preference, or cultural background, to provide deeper insights and make adjustments based on it.
